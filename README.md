# CompositeBuildings
this package is intended as an extension to LightOSM.jl since I want to not only fetch the building data but also, if available, the building parts, to more accurately model the actual urban landscape.

Disclaimer: I have no idea what I am doing. Stuff WILL break. Use with care. You have been warned.
